# Life-Expectancy-and-Development-Analytics-Dashboard-Insights


Project Overview
This project analyzes global life expectancy and development indicators, providing insights into health, education, and economic factors affecting longevity across different countries. The dashboard, built using Power BI, is designed to support policymakers and health organizations in identifying trends, making data-driven decisions, and prioritizing interventions.

Objectives
Analyze Life Expectancy: Understand factors contributing to life expectancy variations across countries.
Visualize Health, Education, and Economic Indicators: Showcase the role of these indicators in human development.
Identify Key Patterns and Trends: Highlight critical insights, such as vaccination coverage and economic impact on health outcomes.
Data & KPIs
The dataset includes multiple indicators relevant to human development, such as life expectancy, health expenditure, education levels, and income composition. Key performance indicators (KPIs) in this dashboard include:

Average Life Expectancy: Indicates overall health across populations.
Average Income Composition of Resources: Reflects economic stability contributing to development.
Average Schooling Years: Highlights educational attainment levels.
Vaccination Coverage: Shows immunization rates for diseases like Hepatitis B, Diphtheria, Polio, and Measles.
Average Adult Mortality Rate: A snapshot of adult health risks.
Average Under-Five Mortality Rate: Provides insight into child health status.
Dashboard Insights & Visualizations
Life Expectancy Trends: Line chart displaying life expectancy trends over years, segmented by developed and developing countries.
Life Expectancy by Country: Bar chart identifying countries with the highest and lowest life expectancy rates.
GDP vs. Life Expectancy: Scatter plot highlighting the relationship between economic performance and health outcomes.
Health Expenditure by Country: Bar chart illustrating how countries allocate resources to health.
Schooling Trends: Line chart showing educational trends over time.
Top Countries with Highest and Lowest Life Expectancy: Donut and pie charts visualizing countries with extreme life expectancy values.
